# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Development Commands

- **Development with hot reload**: `make dev` (uses air for hot reloading)
- **Build**: `make build` (outputs to ./bin/server)
- **Run**: `make run` (builds then runs)
- **Test**: `make test` (runs all tests with -v flag)
- **Clean**: `make clean` (removes ./bin and ./tmp directories)

## Architecture Overview

This is a Go REST API backend for a medication tracking application (`okusuri-backend`).

### Project Structure
- **cmd/server/main.go**: Entry point - sets up DB, runs migrations, configures routes, starts server on :8080
- **internal/**: Core business logic organized by layer
  - **handler/**: HTTP request handlers (medication, notification)
  - **service/**: Business logic services
  - **repository/**: Data access layer
  - **model/**: Database models (MedicationLog, NotificationSetting, User)
  - **dto/**: Data transfer objects
  - **middleware/**: Auth, CORS, logging middleware
  - **routes.go**: Router setup with dependency injection pattern
- **pkg/config/**: Database configuration and connection management
- **migrations/**: Database migrations

### Key Technologies
- **Web Framework**: Gin
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with GORM ORM
- **Environment**: godotenv for .env loading
- **Hot Reload**: Air (installed via make dev)

### Database Setup
Requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. The application automatically runs migrations on startup.

### API Structure
All endpoints are under `/api` prefix:
- `/api/health`: Health check
- `/api/notification`: Notification sending
- `/api/notification/setting`: Notification settings (auth required)
- `/api/medication-log`: Medication logging endpoints (auth required)
- `/api/medication-status`: Medication status (auth required)

### Authentication
Uses JWT-based authentication middleware for protected routes. User ID is extracted from JWT tokens.

### Core Models
- **MedicationLog**: Tracks medication intake with bleeding status
- **NotificationSetting**: Manages user notification preferences per platform
- **User**: User authentication and identification

## Development Rules

### Language & Communication
- **Language**: Always respond in Japanese when working in this repository
- **Code Comments**: Write code comments in Japanese when appropriate
- **PR Descriptions**: Write PR descriptions in Japanese

### Code Quality & Formatting
- **Code Formatting**: Always run `gofmt -l .` before committing and ensure no files are listed (format with `gofmt -w .` if needed)
- **Dependencies**: Run `go mod tidy` after adding or removing dependencies
- **Testing**: Use testify framework for API tests (`github.com/stretchr/testify`)
- **Test Coverage**: Write tests for new features and bug fixes

### Commit & PR Guidelines
- **Commit Messages**: Write descriptive commit messages in Japanese that explain the purpose of changes
- **Commit Granularity**: Make appropriately sized commits - not too large, not too small
- **Claude Code Signature**: Include the following signature in commit messages:
  ```
  ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
  
  Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
  ```
- **Issue Linking**: Link PRs to issues using `Closes #XX` when applicable
- **PR Structure**: One feature per PR - keep changes focused and reviewable

### Development Workflow
- **Branch Strategy**: Create feature branches from main (`feature/description`)
- **Testing**: Run tests before committing (`make test`)
- **Build Verification**: Ensure code builds successfully (`make build`)
- **Hot Reload**: Use `make dev` for development with hot reload
